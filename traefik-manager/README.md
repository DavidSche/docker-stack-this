## Quick trial of this Docker Stack

My goal is to make it freaking fast to try something via a Docker Stack setup. I consider this README crystal clear. If there is anything that I could improve, please let me know. 

Traefik version is defined [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/blob/master/traefik-manager/proxy.yml#L6)

## ACME

ACME, is supported within this configuration and I [working on it](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/issues/5)!

## Setup

1. Go to http://labs.play-with-docker.com/ 
2. Create **1** instance and wait about 20 sec
3. On **node1**, copy-paste:

```
# Create Swarm
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0
\
# List nodes
docker node ls
\
# Clone repo
apk update && apk upgrade && apk add nano curl bash git wget unzip ca-certificates
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this.git
cd docker-stack-this/traefik-manager
mkdir -p /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/
touch /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/acme.json
\
# Launch all services
./_up
```

- `docker service ls` is refreshing automatically
- All service are running. Good! `CTRL-C` to quit the watch mode.
- Click on 8080 to see Traefik dashboard
- Click on 80
- You see `404 page not found`.
- It‚Äôs ok :)

## See our services

Here is the address I see during my PWD session:

```
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/
```

Just point to one of your 6 containers this way:

```
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/a-who
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/a-cad
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/a-gix
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/a-der

http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/b-who
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/b-cad
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/b-gix
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/b-der
```

**The logic is:**

- instance `a` of `who` by emile 
- instance `b` of `who` by emile
- instance `a` of `caddy`
- instance `b` of `caddy`
- instance `a` of `nginx`
- instance `b` of `nginx`
- instance `a` of `who` by jwilder
- instance `b` of `who` by jwilder

All instances have `replicas=3`. I think this is a solid case to understand an valide how to run this reverse-proxy.

## up, down, restart

Execute:
- `./_run`
- `./_stop`
- `./_restart` (typical flow when I debbug)

This is all I got! You are welcome :)

## A last word

**P.S.** If you have solid skills ü§ì with Docker Swarm, Linux bash and the gang* and you would love to help a startup to launch üî• a solid project, I would love to get to know you üçª. Buzz me üëã on Twitter [@askpascalandy](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can see the things that are done and the things we have to do [here](http://firepress.org/blog/technical-challenges-we-are-facing-now/).

I‚Äôm looking for bright and caring people to join this [journey](http://firepress.org/blog/tag/from-the-heart/) with me.

Thanks in advance!
Pascal
