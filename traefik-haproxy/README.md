# Quickly try this stack

I consider this README crystal clear. It should be quick for you to try the elements of this repo. If there is anything that I could improve, please let me know. **Source**: https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this

**Why using a traefik + socketproxy**?
Listen to this: https://cl.ly/1z0Q3a0K1M15

## Setup

1. On http://labs.play-with-docker.com/ create five instances.
2. Wait about 30sec after node5 is deployed to ensure the machines have a network.

3. On **node1**, copy-paste:

```
# Create Swarm
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0
TOKEN_LEAD=$(docker swarm join-token -q manager)
TOKEN_WORK=$(docker swarm join-token -q worker)
for N in $(seq 2 3); do
  DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node$N:2375 docker swarm join --token $TOKEN_LEAD node1:2377
done
for N in $(seq 4 5); do
  DOCKER_HOST=tcp://node$N:2375 docker swarm join --token $TOKEN_WORK node1:2377
done
\
# List nodes
docker node ls
\
# Clone repo
apk update && apk upgrade && apk add nano curl bash git
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this.git
cd docker-stack-this/traefik-haproxy
\
# Launch all services
./start
```

## Start and stop

Execute: `./start` and `./stop`

## A last word

**P.S.** If you have solid skills ü§ì with Docker Swarm, Bash (and the gang)‚Ä¶ plus you would love üíö to help a startup to launch üî• a solid project, I would love to get to know you üçª. Buzz me üëã on Twitter [@askpascalandy](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). I‚Äôm looking for bright and caring people to join in this journey üåá.

Here, I [shared the details](http://firepress.org/blog/technical-challenges-we-are-facing-now/) of the challenges I‚Äôm facing at the moment.

Cheers!
