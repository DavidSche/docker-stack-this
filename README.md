## Goal

One of my goals here is to create the **easiest** and **quickest** demo available around the **Docker Swarm ecosystem**. I really wished I had this when I started (while back when docker-compose was called fig).

## Build on top of it

I hope the community will use this repo as a base project to demo other stuff like CMS, Log, Monitoring, Volume and Storage, Dbs, Benchmark tools and other cool applications we love to use in Docker.

To accomplish this, we put together the power of:

- play-with-docker (#pwg)
- Docker Swarm mode
- Docker stacks

## Start here

This is a monorepo or an aggregation of mini-projects if you prefer. Just navigate the directories! The most solid stack at the moment is: `traefik_stack1`.
