# Context
I believe we need one common way to share Docker stacks over the open-source community. Thanks to **play-with-docker** (PWD) itâ€™s now easy to do. 

I consider this README crystal clear make this stack blazinglyi-ish fast to try out. If there is anything that I could improve here, please buzz me (see below how).

Just navigate the directories!

Cheers!
